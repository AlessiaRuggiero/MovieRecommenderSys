# MovieRecommender_ContentBased

## The Task
#### This Movie Recommender System is tasked with performing content-based filtering to recommend 10 movies with common features to a given movie. 

## The Data
#### The data used belongs to the MovieLens 20M Dataset from Kaggle. It can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset.

## The Program
#### The program creates movie metadata by stringing together each movie’s associated genre terms and tags; this is the content on which the content-based filtering is applied. A TF-IDF matrix is generated containing the TF-IDF scores of the terms present in the collection of metadata. The resulting TF-IDF matrix is then used to generate a Cosine Similarity matrix in which each movie’s metadata is considered a vector of terms represented by their TF-IDF scores, and is compared with every other movie’s. Recommendations are then generated by indexing into the entry for the given movie in the Cosine Similarity matrix, sorting its cosine similarity scores, and returning the top 10 scores (excluding the highest cosine similarity score of 1 evaluated by comparing the given movie with itself). 

#### This program is written in Python and utilizes the pandas, numpy, and sklearn libraries.
